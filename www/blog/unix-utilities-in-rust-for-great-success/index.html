    <p>I've often been asked for suggestions for an appropriate first project in Rust, and I think
    that writing a version of a unix utility is a great choice, for a bunch of reasons!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There is a diverse and colorful cast of characters to choose from that all provide an
        appropriate scope and difficulty level, such as:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>tree</code>: Print a graphical representation tree in visual form</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>strings</code>: Extract plaintext strings from binary files</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>wc</code>: Count the lines, characters, and bytes in a file</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>ls</code>: List the contents of a directory</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>nc</code>: Read and write bytes to network sockets</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>cal</code>: Print a cute text calendar</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>cat</code>: Copy streams to stdout</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>cut</code>: Extract delimited fields from linewise text records</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>sort</code>: Sort lines</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>uniq</code>: Print only unique lines</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The existing implementation provided by your system serves as a specification, giving
        you an idea of how the tool works and whether or not your implementation has the same
        behavior.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The core functionality of these utilities is very simple, allowing a learner to quickly
        build something useful. And, many have additional features, allowing a learner to add and
        build if they wish. <code>ls</code> is simple, but <code>ls -l</code> is quite the
        project!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Many creative additions are possible, like colorful output, expressive configuration,
        and fun and useful new features.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>IO and error handling are often front-and-center when writing these utilities, which
        provides a great chance to get used to explicit error handling.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt">structopt</a> makes argument parsing a
        breeze. And, by leveraging the type system and custom-derive, it provides a nice example of
        a situation where Rust has enormous advantages over other languages, allowing you to do
        more with less code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rust binaries are fast to load and run, so performance is on par with native C
        implementations, and often much better than implementations in slower languages.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rust binaries are self-contained, so packaging and distribution is manageable, so you
        can share your work with the world.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It's fun to use utilities that you wrote in your day-to-day workflow!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are lots of fabulous examples of utilities in the rust ecosystem, like <a href=
        "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, <a href=
        "https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">exa</a>, and <a href=
        "https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl">hexyl</a>. (Damn, David Peter is a beast.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you're teaching others, a simple utility like <code>strings</code> makes for a great
        demonstration of the basics of the language.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think whether you start with the book or a project like this depends on the learner.</p>
    <p>I much prefer to jump in and struggle mightily, so I started with a project like this (what
    eventually became <a href="https://github.com/casey/just/">just</a>), but I think a lot of
    people might prefer to start with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>, or at
    least parts of the book.</p>
