    <p>Investing in cryptocurrencies is not the same as buying simple equity in a company.</p>
    <p>Although each company has a different business model, they and the equity they issue are
    largely structurally homogeneous. They hold their monies in banks, pay for their expenses with
    wire transfers and cheques, follow prescribed rules of accounting, and issue stock that
    operates according to well understood rules. This is not to say that said practices are good or
    bad. They are simply a known factor.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies and tokens, however, are structurally heterogeneous. They have different
    codebases, modes of operation, levels of complexity, and security models. Although broadly
    lumped into the same category, they can, by the nature of these differences, have almost
    nothing in common.</p>
    <p>Investing in one is like buying stock in a company with novel business models, banking
    practices, and accounting methods, and furthermore whose stock is issued under a bespoke scheme
    and follows unique trading rules.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, a much, much greater level of care is required when making such investments. If
    any one of these novel mechanisms fail, your investment may go up in billowing smoke and flames
    overnight.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that you should completely avoid cryptocurrencies and tokens, just, you
    know, do your homework.</p>
