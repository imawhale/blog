    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a>-inspired modification of
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04439">Dandelion</a> for use in <a href=
    "https://grin-tech.org/">Grin</a>.</p>
    <h3><em>What</em></h3>
    <p>On boot and restart, Grin nodes pick a random 256-bit <em>node id</em> which is broadcast to
    their peers.</p>
    <p>Upon receiving a block, a new <em>epoch</em> begins if <code>block_height % 10 == 0</code>.
    The <em>epoch id</em> is the 256-bit blake2b hash of the block hash of the block that started
    the epoch. (I.E. the double blake2b hash of the block header.)</p>
    <p>At the start of each epoch, every node:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Calculates the <em>relay weight</em> of itself and all peers using the formula:
        <code>relay_weight = peer_id xor epoch_id</code>. Relay weight is interpreted as a 256 bit
        unsigned integer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selects the node among itself and all peers with the highest relay weight as the
        <em>relay target</em>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Determines that it is in <em>stem mode</em> if the relay target is a peer, and in
        <em>fluff mode</em> if the relay target is itself.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, for every stem transaction received:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If it is in stem mode, it immediately relays it to its relay target.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If it is in fluff mode, it aggregates transactions until its next patience timer
        expires, then broadcast them.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Why</em></h3>
    <p>"Heavy" peers will naturally be chosen for relay targets, creating agreed-upon stem paths
    and fluff sinks, and leading to more opportunities for transaction aggregation.</p>
    <h3><em>Notes</em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In a well-connected network, one node may be the sink for all transactions during a
        given epoch, and thus see all unaggregated transactions during the epoch. It may thus be
        desirable to stick to random mode selection as in Dandelion++, so as to break up stem paths
        with randomly selected fluff sinks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If block hashes are used directly as the epoch ID, peers could select peer IDs with a
        large number of leading 1s, thus biasing relay target selection towards themselves. Thus,
        we take the double blake2b hash of the block header as the epoch ID.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the epoch ID is known by all, a node could pick node IDs that had high relay
        weight during that epoch. To provent this, if a node connects to a new peer it should use a
        randomly assigned peer ID for the current epoch.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Should this modification be called <em>Kademlion</em>, or
        <em>Objective-Dandelion</em>?</p>
      </li>
      <li>

        "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues/2176">clear description of Dandelion++</a>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network">Lightning Network</a> has
      the potential to greatly improve cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Lighting Network payment channels could be established between users and exchanges to
      speed the transfer of funds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>This would be a huge boon, moving many on-chain deposit and withdrawal transactions
      off-chain, but is possibly only the beginning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Since Lightning Network payments can span different blockchains, an exchange could use a
      cross-chain Lightning node to expose its internal order book to external entities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As an example, imagine that an exchange has an LTC/BTC trading pair and wants to allow
      non-exchange users to fill the orders in their order book.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The exchange runs a lightning node with a BTC channel and an LTC channel:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>x:   exchange node
a:   third party node
b:   third party node
&lt;-&gt;: payment channel

   BTC     LTC
a &lt;---&gt; x &lt;---&gt; b</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The exchange dynamically sets the exchange rates across the channels based on their
      current best bid, best ask, and fee schedule.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>With a best ask of 0.6 and a 1% fee, the exchange sets the BTC→LTC exchange rate like
      so:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>   BTC     LTC
a ----&gt; x ----&gt; b
  0.606   1.000</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When a payment is routed across the channels in this direction, LTC sell orders are
      filled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>With a best bid of 0.4 and a 1% fee, the exchange sets the exchange rate on the channel in
      the LTC→BTC direction like so:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>   BTC     LTC
a &lt;---- x &lt;---- b
  0.400   1.010</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>A payment routed in this direction fills LTC buy orders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In this way, exchanges can expose their internal order book externally and trustlessly.
      Anyone who wishes to make cross-chain Lightning Network payments will discover and travel
      over these routes with no special effort required by the exchange, assuming that their rates
      are competitive. Also, it’s likely that third parties will appear whose sole purpose is to
      search the Lightning Network for arbitrage loops and travel them until they are exhausted,
      thus bridging multiple exchanges when their order books cross.</p>

      <p>IOTA is a cryptocurrency targeting the internet of things. It purports to be scalable,

      <span class="tags"><a href="/blog/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a></span>
    </header>
    <p>Investing in cryptocurrencies is not the same as buying simple equity in a company.</p>
    <p>Although each company has a different business model, they and the equity they issue are
    largely structurally homogeneous. They hold their monies in banks, pay for their expenses with
    wire transfers and cheques, follow prescribed rules of accounting, and issue stock that
    operates according to well understood rules. This is not to say that said practices are good or
    bad. They are simply a known factor.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies and tokens, however, are structurally heterogeneous. They have different
    codebases, modes of operation, levels of complexity, and security models. Although broadly
    lumped into the same category, they can, by the nature of these differences, have almost
    nothing in common.</p>
    <p>Investing in one is like buying stock in a company with novel business models, banking
    practices, and accounting methods, and furthermore whose stock is issued under a bespoke scheme
    and follows unique trading rules.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, a much, much greater level of care is required when making such investments. If
    any one of these novel mechanisms fail, your investment may go up in billowing smoke and flames
    overnight.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that you should completely avoid cryptocurrencies and tokens, just, you
    know, do your homework.</p>
