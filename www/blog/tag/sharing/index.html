    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>I've just published the first release of Intermodal, a command-line BitTorrent metainfo
    utility.</p>
    <p>It can create, display, and verify <code>.torrent</code> files, as well as generate magnet
    links.</p>
    <p>The binary is called <code>imdl</code>.</p>
    <p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/casey/intermodal">here</a>, try it out, and let me know
    what you think!</p>

    <h2>What happened to your personal library?</h2>
    <p>Rows of LPs, shelves of VHS tapes, binders of CDs and DVDs, or maybe hard drives stuffed to
    overflowing.</p>
    <p>It used to be common to maintain a personal content library, but in the last decade, most of
    us stopped. We ditched the tedium of tagging and sorting for Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube.</p>
    <p>Whenever I think about this I feel a wistful longing for the past. And I don't think it's
    just nostalgia.</p>
    <p>Modern content channels are usually designed around a feed and automatic recommendations,
    and don't make a strong distinction between things that are in <em>your</em> library and
    everything else. This makes it too easy to consume content compulsively and replaces active
    search and curation with guzzling down what's on tap, biasing me away from what <em>I</em> like
    and towards what <em>everyone else</em> likes.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, once-accessible items often disappear due to obscure legal and contractual
    machinations out of one's control.</p>
    <p>Worse still, content that is below an invisible popularity threshold is hard to find, not
    available, or doesn't appear in recommendation streams. One of my favorite tracks from my old
    music library was a song from a collection of music by people on Usenet called "It's Six AM and
    Gary's Refrigerator Plays a Raga". Definitely not available on Spotify.</p>
    <p>And, if you make something yourself, you can't just put it into your own library, or send it
    to a friend so they can throw it in theirs.</p>
    <p>This is profoundly saddening.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>How did we get here?</h2>
    <p>I think we stopped curating our own libraries due to three factors: ease of use, features,
    and incentives. These factors have pushed people away from decentralized content networks, like
    BitTorrent and store-bought CDs, and towards centralized apps, like Spotify and Netflix.</p>
    <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
    <p>For all their flaws, centralized apps are incredibly easy to use. Just open a browser tab
    and play.</p>
    <p>To get content into your own library and play it, you need to use a number of applications
    in concert­a web browser to search, another app to download, a file browser to organize, and
    finally a player to listen or watch. This is doable, but is a huge chore compared to
    centralized apps.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>Centralized apps maintain large, proprietary databases of metadata, so features like search,
    recommendation, and preview work flawlessly.</p>
    <p>Most desirable features are only as good as the metadata they're built on, so if you're
    curating a personal library, you have to curate the metadata along with it.</p>
    <p>This is the primary reason I gave up on my personal music library: I spent endless amounts
    of time making sure that metadata was uniform and correct, and although I found some great
    tools to help, it still felt like a part-time job.</p>
    <h3>Incentives</h3>
    <p>Centralized apps usually have built-in monetization mechanisms. If you like content you find
    through decentralized channels and want to support the creator or publisher, there is no easy
    means to do so.</p>
    <p>Because of this, first-party releases on decentralized content networks are rare, and
    resources are instead lavished on centralized apps.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
    <p>The feature-gap between centralized apps and decentralized content networks is vast.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there is a relatively simple way that we can close that gap:</p>
    <p>Developing standards for structured, machine-readable metadata in a simple, universal
    format.</p>
    <p>Existing content does contain metadata. However, this metadata is limited to specific
    content types, for example MP3 tags; or modes of transport, for example BitTorrent.</p>
    <p>By developing a standard for metadata manifests that can be accompany content, many
    desirable features become more reliable and dramatically easier to implement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Newly downloaded releases can be integrated into a library without user intervention. If
        the user has a preferred scheme for naming and tagging, that scheme can be applied
        automatically.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Content from a user's library can easily be exported for sharing in a format that's
        appropriate for the transportation medium, for example as a torrent or as a
        <code>.zip</code> archive.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By identifying the location and format of content in releases, that content can be
        extracted and transcoded automatically for mobile devices and web browsers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rich search indices can be built from collections of content, without needing to resort
        to complex and error-prone heuristics.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Immutable identifiers, for example ISBN numbers, allow metadata to be automatically
        updated from external sources.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Creators and publishers can include a Bitcoin tipping address in their releases, so end
        users can reward them directly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Releases can be signed, allowing users to verify the authenticity of content, and
        allowing publishers to create new releases that explicitly supersede old ones.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Standardized metadata would be a enormous boon to the decentralized content ecosystem, and
    the Intermodal project is my attempt to make this possibility a reality.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Intermodal</h2>
    <p>The project for developing these metadata standards, as well as tools and apps to make these
    standards useful, is called "Intermodal".</p>
    <p>Seamless intermodal transportation, enabled by containerization, has led to enormous
    efficiency gains in the transport of physical goods.</p>
    <p>Before the invention of the humble 40' shipping container, and the intermodal transportation
    network that it enabled, the majority of the world's goods were transported as so-called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_bulk_cargo">bulk break cargo</a>.</p>
    <p>Bulk break cargo is packed in bags, barrels, boxes, crates, and drums of varying sizes.
    Loading such cargo onto a truck, cargo ship, or train took labor and time, and was a major
    source of friction and cost in the shipping of goods from place to place.</p>
    <p>The invention and standardization of intermodal containers, the 20' and 40' shipping
    containers of today, changed all that. Cargo could now be packed into uniformly sized
    containers of known strength and weight, of a size suitable for transportation by train, truck,
    or ship. This standardization made the once back-breaking work of moving cargo through multiple
    transportation modes easy and fast. What once required teams of stout men could now be done
    easily with cranes and other equipment.</p>
    <p>In many ways, when it comes to decentralized digital content, we are very much living in an
    era of bulk break cargo. Painstaking effort is required to prepare content for transportation
    across different modes, e.g. BitTorrent, the web, or Usenet; and it is either impossible or
    takes complex heuristics to answer simple questions, like what <em>is</em> a piece of content,
    anyways?</p>
    <p>By standardizing metadata, we can make more efficient the conveyance of digital content
    across different modes of transportation, and allow rich services to be built on top of that
    content.</p>
    <p>Thus, "Intermodal".</p>

    <h2><code>imdl</code></h2>
    <p>After much hand-wringing and false starts, I decided that a good place to start would be a
    BitTorrent metainfo (that is to say, <code>.torrent</code> file) creator. The first version is
    full of features and niceties, and is ready for users today.</p>
    <p>The binary is called <code>imdl</code>, and development is hosted <a href=
    "https://github.com/casey/intermodal">on GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>BitTorrent is widely used, and a torrent creator is much simpler than a torrent client,
    tracker, or index, making a good place to start.</p>
    <p>Although <code>imdl</code> does not today have any groundbreaking new features, and no
    functionality for creating metadata manifests, it is a natural place to start adding such
    features.</p>
    <p><code>imdl</code> is written in Rust. Rust is fast, correct, and makes it easy to distribute
    self-contained binaries to users. Additionally, Rust can be compiled to <a href=
    "https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, so bits of <code>imdl</code> might eventually be
    adapted to run in the browser.</p>
    <p><code>imdl</code> will hopefully be extended with all manner of useful features, so
    torrent-creation functionality lives under the <code>torrent</code> subcommand: <code>imdl
    torrent create</code>, <code>imdl torrent verify</code>, <code>imdl torrent show</code>, and so
    on.</p>
    <p>I've tried to add all the useful features of existing torrent file creators that I could
    find, so hopefully <code>imdl</code> is immediately useful. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to
    the <a href="https://imdl.io/book/prior-art.html">many exiting open-source torrent
    creators</a>, which have been a font of inspiration and good ideas.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>First and foremost, I want <code>imdl</code> to be a useful torrent creator <em>today</em>.
    If you find any bugs, or have feature requests, don't hesitate to <a href=
    "https://github.com/casey/intermodal/issues/new">open an issue</a> or hop on <a href=
    "https://discord.gg/HaaT5Qz">the discord</a>!</p>
    <p>Contributions of code, documentation, clean up, tests, ideas, and discussion are all
    welcome!</p>
    <p>Beyond that, there are a few possible next steps.</p>
    <p>One possibility is fleshing out the standards for content metadata that I've described
    above. However, I'm not sure it's the right thing to do just yet. I'm worried that without any
    consumers of this metadata, like trackers and indices, I'll be designing for abstract users and
    use-cases, which is always a dangerous way to work.</p>
    <p>Another possibility is adding a simple tracker and web index to <code>imdl</code>. I could
    then work on the metadata standard while adding features that consume this metadata to the
    tracker and index. This would help ensure that the new metadata standard actually enables the
    intended concrete use-cases.</p>
    <p>I think the latter is more likely, but nothing is set in stone.</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for reading this rather long-winded blog post!</p>
    <p><code>imdl</code>, modest though it may be, is a love letter to the world, to sharing, and
    to BitTorrent. I hope you find it useful, and it becomes even more useful in the future.</p>
