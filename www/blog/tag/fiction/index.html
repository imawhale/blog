    <p>I woke up last night after only a few hours of sleep, sweaty and disoriented.</p>
    <p>Maybe it was miasmatic vapors rising up from beneath South of Market streets. Maybe it was
    the widening gyre opening up under the world. Maybe it was nothing at all. I don't know.</p>
    <p>It felt like the world had ended, but I was still there. And the lights of the city
    glimmered through the window, so, it was still there too.</p>

    <p>This is pretty nuts. I was poking around in the storage area of my house, and I found a huge
    cardboard box filled with letters and audio cassettes and dust. Everything was Danish, German,
    and English, but mostly Danish. The name Max Rasmussen was everywhere, so I think it was all
    his stuff. I had to get a tape player at best buy to play the tapes, but surprisingly, they all
    played fine. One of them was an interview, in English, between Max and a man named Hans. I
    listened to it a few times, and I don't even know what to say. It's transcribed below.</p>

    <p>"Well," he began, moving closer to her, "declarative programming is when you tell the
    computer what you want, and then the computer figures out how to get it. Pretty sweet,
    huh?"</p>
    <p>"What kinds of things can you tell the computer you want?" she asked excitedly, her cheeks
    beginning to flush.</p>
    <p>He thought for a moment, and began stroking her hair gently. "All kinds of things. There's a
    language called prolog you can use to ask about logical relationships. In SQL you can ask
    questions about huge quantities of data. With a program like bison you can declaratively
    describe a language, letting bison generate a program that recognizes it."</p>
    <p>"Oh," she said breathlessly, leaning her head on his shoulder, "so I don't have to worry
    about choosing an algorithm--the computer will pick one for me?"</p>
