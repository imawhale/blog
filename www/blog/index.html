    <h2>What happened to your personal library?</h2>
    <p>Rows of LPs, shelves of VHS tapes, binders of CDs and DVDs, or maybe hard drives stuffed to
    overflowing.</p>
    <p>It used to be common to maintain a personal content library, but in the last decade, most of
    us stopped. We ditched the tedium of tagging and sorting for Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube.</p>
    <p>Whenever I think about this I feel a wistful longing for the past. And I don't think it's
    just nostalgia.</p>

    </header>
    <p>Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">funding a team</a>
    to decentralize social media. I think they should start with messaging.</p>
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <h3>Why</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Messaging is a subset of social media.</li>
      <li>Users are tired of the wild proliferation of messaging apps.</li>
      <li>Social networks are all different, making them hard targets for standardization;
      messaging apps are all the same, making them easy targets for standardization and
      interoperability.</li>
      <li>Messaging is easier to scale.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Build on the matrix protocol.</li>
      <li>Extend email.</li>
      <li>Or maybe both.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why</h2>
    <h3>messaging is a subset of social media</h3>
    <p>Messaging is a key feature of all social media platforms; decentralizing messaging is a
    prerequisite to decentralizing social media. And, even though it is a subset of social media,
    it still captures many of social media's central challenges: spam, moderation, and, most
    importantly, identity.</p>
    <h3>users are tired of the wild proliferation of messaging apps</h3>
    <p>The average user is more negatively impacted by the proliferation of messaging apps than
    they are by the proliferation of social networks.</p>
    <p>I have heard many people express irritation that they must use an inordinate number of
    messaging apps to communicate.</p>
    <p>I haven't heard the same complaints regarding the proliferation of social media platforms.
    My best as to why this is the case is that the need to communicate one-on-one with an
    individual has no substitute. If I'm meeting Bob for lunch, being able to message anyone but
    Bob is completely useless. So, I must use whichever app Bob uses, or get Bob to use whatever
    app I use, and, if we don't have a common messaging app, one of us will need to install a new
    one, furthering the proliferation problem.</p>
    <h3>social network distinctiveness</h3>
    <p>It's tempting to think that decentralizing social media should be begin with the features
    that we most readily associate with social media platforms, like posts, news feeds, and liking.
    However, the implementations of these features differ, and different social media platforms
    provide very different experiences.</p>
    <p>This makes these features of social media a hard target for standardization. However, the
    messaging features of these platforms are all nearly identical, making messaging an easy target
    for standardization.</p>
    <p>The goal is to decentralize social media as a whole, not just messaging, but messaging can
    be used as an initial step, with further extensions tackling the various individual features of
    social media platforms.</p>
    <h3>messaging is easier to scale</h3>
    <p>At the upper end, tens of millions of users may engage with an individual tweet, whereas
    group messages are limited to no more than fifty users. This makes messaging a more attractive
    initial target for decentralization, since it avoids needing to hit massive scale on day
    one.</p>
    <h3>a clear target</h3>
    <p>So, to summarize all the above, decentralized messaging has an obvious target feature set to
    aim for, a strong benefit to end users that will drive adoption, puts off hard scaling
    challenges, and can be extended in the future to all the features we associate with social
    media.</p>
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>I see two promising and complementary paths to decentralized messaging: building on the new
    and shiny <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix protocol</a>, and gradually extending email.</p>
    <p>The Matrix protocol has the huge advantage of being modern. It already supports many, if not
    most, of the features of modern messaging apps.</p>
    <p>Email, on the other hand, is ancient, weird, and has no support for modern luxuries like
    end-to-end encryption or user-presence notifications. However, email is extremely widely
    adopted, and a broadly supported and popular "Email 2.0" might receive a great deal of
    support.</p>
    <p>Although it would be a challenging process to navigate, email could be extended with
    features until it reaches parity with modern messaging apps, and further extended to support
    the features of existing social media networks. These extensions can be added in backwards
    compatible ways that allow mail agents to negotiate upgrades, falling back to plain email when
    extensions are not available.</p>
    <p>These extensions could include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>delivery receipts</li>
      <li>optional read receipts</li>
      <li>user presence information</li>
      <li>binary serialization for efficiency and extensibility</li>
      <li>end-to-end encryption</li>
      <li>WebRTC signalling for negotiating VOIP and video chat</li>
      <li>signed introduction tokens to reduce spam</li>
      <li>a standard extension mechanism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A hybrid approach might be to design an email-to-matrix protocol upgrade negotiation
    mechanism, allowing legacy email addresses to seamlessly upgrade to a modern messaging
    protocol.</p>
    <p>Whatever the approach, building a decentralized messaging protocol and integrating it into
    twitter would serve as an excellent foot in the door for decentralizing the entire social media
    landscape.</p>

      Become a Browser</a> <span class="tags"><a href=
      "/blog/tag/programming/">programming</a></span>
    </header>
    <p><em>I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice.</em></p>
    <p>Popcorn Time-style video streaming apps seem to be vulnerable to legal action by
    rightsholders.</p>
    <p>For example, the <a href=
    "https://torrentfreak.com/registrar-suspends-popcorn-time-domain-name-following-complaint-200121/">
    popcorntime.sh domain was recently suspended</a>, and <a href=
    "https://torrentfreak.com/operator-of-popcorn-time-info-site-is-liable-for-piracy-supreme-court-rules-200115/">
    the operator of a site which merely provided information about how to obtain and use Popcorn
    Time was sentenced to prison</a>.</p>
    <p>Although given that Popcorn Time's servers do not themselves host infringing content this
    may seem a bit unfair, it is simply the reality of the world we live in.</p>
    <p>It is interesting to note, however, that although web browsers can be used in exactly the
    same way as Popcorn Time, namely searching for and viewing copyrighted movies, the developers
    of web browsers have thus far not faced successful legal challenges.</p>
    <p>I believe that there are two major factors that differentiate Popcorn Time from web
    browsers, and contribute to Popcorn Time's legal vulnerability:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Upon opening a web browser, the user must supply the URL of the site they wish to visit.
        Compare this to Popcorn Time, where upon opening the application for the first time, the
        user is immediately presented with a selection of unlicensed Hollywood movies to
        download.</p>
        <p>This difference greatly weakens Popcorn Time's claims against contributory copyright
        infringement. The developers of Popcorn Time cannot credibly claim to be ignorant to the
        types of movies that their users are downloading, whereas a web browser developer can
        credibly claim that the choice of website to visit is always left to the end user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Web browsers have substantial non-infringing uses. "Substantial non-infringing use" is
        jargon for a legal test used in the United States which protects the creator or purveyor of
        a piece of technology from liability for its use in infringement by users if that
        technology has "substantial non-infringing uses". For the canonical example, see <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Universal_City_Studios,_Inc."><em>Sony
        Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.</em></a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Whereas a web browser provider can rightly claim that there are many websites, <a href=
    "https://youtu.be/2JO3oJybBTw">and it's possible an infringing one might slip in, there would
    be no way of knowing</a>, the popcorn time developers cannot claim the same. There is a single,
    fixed Popcorn Time backend, run by the Popcorn Time team, serving the same search results to
    every user.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, even given the above, I believe that Popcorn Time could implement a small
    number of strategic changes that would allow it to withstand future legal aggression:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a URL bar, like a web browser's, to the top of the current GUI.</li>
      <li>Make the URL bar empty when opening the app for the first time, and display no default
      search results to the user.</li>
      <li>When the user enters a URL, use the existing Popcorn Time API protocol to contact the
      backend at that URL, and begin displaying search results from that backend to the user.</li>
      <li>If the app is closed and re-opened, keep the URL bar and the search results populated
      from the last run of the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These changes would be simple, have a minimal impact on the current (quite excellent!) user
    experience, and leverage interaction flows, i.e. a URL bar, that users already understand.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the Popcorn Time team should create an official default search backend which
    focuses exclusively on free, non-infringing, user-created content.</p>
    <p>These steps would, I believe, nicely protect the developers and distributors of Popcorn Time
    from further legal challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Popcorn Time, when first opened, would display no search results by default, and would
        require the user to direct the app with the URL of a site that they would like to visit.
        This would avoid the current situation where a litigator sitting in front of a judge can
        open the Popcorn Time application, and it will by immediately display a choice selection of
        infringing content, which makes for a terrible first impression.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Users of the Popcorn Time application could use it to access both infringing and
        non-infringing content, providing a nice argument that the application does in fact have
        <em>substantial non-infringing uses</em>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Infringement via the application would be entirely at the direction of the end-user, and
        not directly assisted by the default search results provided by the developers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Developers wouldn't be running a search back end with infringing content, which is the
        only component of the current Popcorn Time system that stores problematic metadata about
        infringing content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I suspect that the official free-content focused search backend would be successful and
        useful in its own right.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the search backend could now be switched by end users, a very large number of
        third-party backends would likely appear, serving content that might not be otherwise
        available from the current Popcorn Time backend.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, Popcorn Time should become a browser, and then all those lawyers and their
    handlers can go pound sand.</p>

      Rust for Great Success</a> <span class="tags"><a href=
      "/blog/tag/programming/">programming</a></span>
    </header>
    <p>I've often been asked for suggestions for an appropriate first project in Rust, and I think
    that writing a version of a unix utility is a great choice, for a bunch of reasons!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There is a diverse and colorful cast of characters to choose from that all provide an
        appropriate scope and difficulty level, such as:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>tree</code>: Print a graphical representation tree in visual form</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>strings</code>: Extract plaintext strings from binary files</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>wc</code>: Count the lines, characters, and bytes in a file</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>ls</code>: List the contents of a directory</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>nc</code>: Read and write bytes to network sockets</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>cal</code>: Print a cute text calendar</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>cat</code>: Copy streams to stdout</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>cut</code>: Extract delimited fields from linewise text records</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>sort</code>: Sort lines</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>uniq</code>: Print only unique lines</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The existing implementation provided by your system serves as a specification, giving
        you an idea of how the tool works and whether or not your implementation has the same
        behavior.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The core functionality of these utilities is very simple, allowing a learner to quickly
        build something useful. And, many have additional features, allowing a learner to add and
        build if they wish. <code>ls</code> is simple, but <code>ls -l</code> is quite the
        project!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Many creative additions are possible, like colorful output, expressive configuration,
        and fun and useful new features.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>IO and error handling are often front-and-center when writing these utilities, which
        provides a great chance to get used to explicit error handling.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt">structopt</a> makes argument parsing a
        breeze. And, by leveraging the type system and custom-derive, it provides a nice example of
        a situation where Rust has enormous advantages over other languages, allowing you to do
        more with less code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rust binaries are fast to load and run, so performance is on par with native C
        implementations, and often much better than implementations in slower languages.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rust binaries are self-contained, so packaging and distribution is manageable, so you
        can share your work with the world.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It's fun to use utilities that you wrote in your day-to-day workflow!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are lots of fabulous examples of utilities in the rust ecosystem, like <a href=
        "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, <a href=
        "https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">exa</a>, and <a href=
        "https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl">hexyl</a>. (Damn, David Peter is a beast.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you're teaching others, a simple utility like <code>strings</code> makes for a great
        demonstration of the basics of the language.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think whether you start with the book or a project like this depends on the learner.</p>
    <p>I much prefer to jump in and struggle mightily, so I started with a project like this (what
    eventually became <a href="https://github.com/casey/just/">just</a>), but I think a lot of
    people might prefer to start with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>, or at
    least parts of the book.</p>

    </header>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a>-inspired modification of
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04439">Dandelion</a> for use in <a href=
    "https://grin-tech.org/">Grin</a>.</p>
    <h3><em>What</em></h3>
    <p>On boot and restart, Grin nodes pick a random 256-bit <em>node id</em> which is broadcast to
    their peers.</p>
    <p>Upon receiving a block, a new <em>epoch</em> begins if <code>block_height % 10 == 0</code>.
    The <em>epoch id</em> is the 256-bit blake2b hash of the block hash of the block that started
    the epoch. (I.E. the double blake2b hash of the block header.)</p>
    <p>At the start of each epoch, every node:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Calculates the <em>relay weight</em> of itself and all peers using the formula:
        <code>relay_weight = peer_id xor epoch_id</code>. Relay weight is interpreted as a 256 bit
        unsigned integer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selects the node among itself and all peers with the highest relay weight as the
        <em>relay target</em>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Determines that it is in <em>stem mode</em> if the relay target is a peer, and in
        <em>fluff mode</em> if the relay target is itself.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, for every stem transaction received:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If it is in stem mode, it immediately relays it to its relay target.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If it is in fluff mode, it aggregates transactions until its next patience timer
        expires, then broadcast them.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Why</em></h3>
    <p>"Heavy" peers will naturally be chosen for relay targets, creating agreed-upon stem paths
    and fluff sinks, and leading to more opportunities for transaction aggregation.</p>
    <h3><em>Notes</em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In a well-connected network, one node may be the sink for all transactions during a
        given epoch, and thus see all unaggregated transactions during the epoch. It may thus be
        desirable to stick to random mode selection as in Dandelion++, so as to break up stem paths
        with randomly selected fluff sinks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If block hashes are used directly as the epoch ID, peers could select peer IDs with a
        large number of leading 1s, thus biasing relay target selection towards themselves. Thus,
        we take the double blake2b hash of the block header as the epoch ID.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the epoch ID is known by all, a node could pick node IDs that had high relay
        weight during that epoch. To provent this, if a node connects to a new peer it should use a
        randomly assigned peer ID for the current epoch.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Should this modification be called <em>Kademlion</em>, or
        <em>Objective-Dandelion</em>?</p>
      </li>

    <p>I woke up last night after only a few hours of sleep, sweaty and disoriented.</p>
    <p>Maybe it was miasmatic vapors rising up from beneath South of Market streets. Maybe it was
    the widening gyre opening up under the world. Maybe it was nothing at all. I don't know.</p>
    <p>It felt like the world had ended, but I was still there. And the lights of the city
    glimmered through the window, so, it was still there too.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network">Lightning Network</a> has
      the potential to greatly improve cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Lighting Network payment channels could be established between users and exchanges to
      speed the transfer of funds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>This would be a huge boon, moving many on-chain deposit and withdrawal transactions
      off-chain, but is possibly only the beginning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Since Lightning Network payments can span different blockchains, an exchange could use a
      cross-chain Lightning node to expose its internal order book to external entities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As an example, imagine that an exchange has an LTC/BTC trading pair and wants to allow
      non-exchange users to fill the orders in their order book.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The exchange runs a lightning node with a BTC channel and an LTC channel:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>x:   exchange node
a:   third party node
b:   third party node
&lt;-&gt;: payment channel

   BTC     LTC
a &lt;---&gt; x &lt;---&gt; b</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The exchange dynamically sets the exchange rates across the channels based on their
      current best bid, best ask, and fee schedule.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>With a best ask of 0.6 and a 1% fee, the exchange sets the BTC→LTC exchange rate like
      so:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>   BTC     LTC
a ----&gt; x ----&gt; b
  0.606   1.000</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When a payment is routed across the channels in this direction, LTC sell orders are
      filled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>With a best bid of 0.4 and a 1% fee, the exchange sets the exchange rate on the channel in
      the LTC→BTC direction like so:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>   BTC     LTC
a &lt;---- x &lt;---- b
  0.400   1.010</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>A payment routed in this direction fills LTC buy orders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In this way, exchanges can expose their internal order book externally and trustlessly.
      Anyone who wishes to make cross-chain Lightning Network payments will discover and travel
      over these routes with no special effort required by the exchange, assuming that their rates
      are competitive. Also, it’s likely that third parties will appear whose sole purpose is to
      search the Lightning Network for arbitrage loops and travel them until they are exhausted,
      thus bridging multiple exchanges when their order books cross.</p>

      <span class="tags"><a href="/blog/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a></span>
    </header>
    <p>Investing in cryptocurrencies is not the same as buying simple equity in a company.</p>
    <p>Although each company has a different business model, they and the equity they issue are
    largely structurally homogeneous. They hold their monies in banks, pay for their expenses with
    wire transfers and cheques, follow prescribed rules of accounting, and issue stock that
    operates according to well understood rules. This is not to say that said practices are good or
    bad. They are simply a known factor.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies and tokens, however, are structurally heterogeneous. They have different
    codebases, modes of operation, levels of complexity, and security models. Although broadly
    lumped into the same category, they can, by the nature of these differences, have almost
    nothing in common.</p>
    <p>Investing in one is like buying stock in a company with novel business models, banking
    practices, and accounting methods, and furthermore whose stock is issued under a bespoke scheme
    and follows unique trading rules.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, a much, much greater level of care is required when making such investments. If
    any one of these novel mechanisms fail, your investment may go up in billowing smoke and flames
    overnight.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that you should completely avoid cryptocurrencies and tokens, just, you
    know, do your homework.</p>

    </header>
    <p>Programs first crawled from the murky oceans as simple lists of instructions that executed
    in sequence. From these humble beginnings they have since evolved an astonishing number of ways
    of delinearizing.</p>
    <p>In fact, most programming paradigms simply amount to different ways to transform a linear
    source file into a program with nonlinear behavior.</p>
    <p>Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>gotos that unconditionally jump to another point in the program</li>
      <li>an abort instruction that stops the program at some point other than the end</li>
      <li>a macro facility that substitutes one instruction for one or more other instructions</li>
      <li>a source file concatenation facility that concatenates multiple source files</li>
      <li>an include directive that is substituted for the contents of a source file</li>
      <li>structured repetition and selection, a la for, while, if, and switch</li>
      <li>subroutines and functions</li>
      <li>array oriented programming that replace explicit repetition with implicit repetition</li>
      <li>first class functions which delegation of behavior to the caller</li>
      <li>object oriented programming with dynamic dispatch, which allow the runtime type of an
      object to determine which instructions to execute</li>
      <li>aspect oriented programming, pattern matching against the structure of the call stack to
      execute instructions when functions are called or return</li>
      <li>event driven programming, executing instructions in response to external events</li>
      <li>declarative programming, which essentially delegates execution of one program to
      another</li>

    <p>This is pretty nuts. I was poking around in the storage area of my house, and I found a huge
    cardboard box filled with letters and audio cassettes and dust. Everything was Danish, German,
    and English, but mostly Danish. The name Max Rasmussen was everywhere, so I think it was all
    his stuff. I had to get a tape player at best buy to play the tapes, but surprisingly, they all
    played fine. One of them was an interview, in English, between Max and a man named Hans. I
    listened to it a few times, and I don't even know what to say. It's transcribed below.</p>

    <p>"Well," he began, moving closer to her, "declarative programming is when you tell the
    computer what you want, and then the computer figures out how to get it. Pretty sweet,
    huh?"</p>
    <p>"What kinds of things can you tell the computer you want?" she asked excitedly, her cheeks
    beginning to flush.</p>
    <p>He thought for a moment, and began stroking her hair gently. "All kinds of things. There's a
    language called prolog you can use to ask about logical relationships. In SQL you can ask
    questions about huge quantities of data. With a program like bison you can declaratively
    describe a language, letting bison generate a program that recognizes it."</p>
    <p>"Oh," she said breathlessly, leaning her head on his shoulder, "so I don't have to worry
    about choosing an algorithm--the computer will pick one for me?"</p>
