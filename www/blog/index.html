    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>I've just published the first release of Intermodal, a command-line BitTorrent metainfo
    utility.</p>
    <p>It can create, display, and verify <code>.torrent</code> files, as well as generate magnet
    links.</p>
    <p>The binary is called <code>imdl</code>.</p>
    <p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/casey/intermodal">here</a>, try it out, and let me know
    what you think!</p>

    <h2>What happened to your personal library?</h2>
    <p>Rows of LPs, shelves of VHS tapes, binders of CDs and DVDs, or maybe hard drives stuffed to
    overflowing.</p>
    <p>It used to be common to maintain a personal content library, but in the last decade, most of
    us stopped. We ditched the tedium of tagging and sorting for Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube.</p>
    <p>Whenever I think about this I feel a wistful longing for the past. And I don't think it's
    just nostalgia.</p>
    <p>Modern content channels are usually designed around a feed and automatic recommendations,
    and don't make a strong distinction between things that are in <em>your</em> library and
    everything else. This makes it too easy to consume content compulsively and replaces active
    search and curation with guzzling down what's on tap, biasing me away from what <em>I</em> like
    and towards what <em>everyone else</em> likes.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, once-accessible items often disappear due to obscure legal and contractual
    machinations out of one's control.</p>
    <p>Worse still, content that is below an invisible popularity threshold is hard to find, not
    available, or doesn't appear in recommendation streams. One of my favorite tracks from my old
    music library was a song from a collection of music by people on Usenet called "It's Six AM and
    Gary's Refrigerator Plays a Raga". Definitely not available on Spotify.</p>
    <p>And, if you make something yourself, you can't just put it into your own library, or send it
    to a friend so they can throw it in theirs.</p>
    <p>This is profoundly saddening.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>How did we get here?</h2>
    <p>I think we stopped curating our own libraries due to three factors: ease of use, features,
    and incentives. These factors have pushed people away from decentralized content networks, like
    BiTorrrent and store-bought CDs, and towards centralized apps, like Spotify and Netflix.</p>
    <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
    <p>For all their flaws, centralized apps are incredibly easy to use. Just open a browser tab
    and play.</p>
    <p>To get content into your own library and play it, you need to use a number of applications
    in concert­a web browser to search, another app to download, a file browser to organize, and
    finally a player to listen or watch. This is doable, but is a huge chore compared to
    centralized apps.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>Centralized apps maintain large, proprietary databases of metadata, so features like search,
    recommendation, and preview work flawlessly.</p>
    <p>Most desirable features are only as good as the metadata they're built on, so if you're
    curating a personal library, you have to curate the metadata along with it.</p>
    <p>This is the primary reason I gave up on my personal music library: I spent endless amounts
    of time making sure that metadata was uniform and correct, and although I found some great
    tools to help, it still felt like a part-time job.</p>
    <h3>Incentives</h3>
    <p>Centralized apps usually have built-in monetization mechanisms. If you like content you find
    through decentralized channels and want to support the creator or publisher, there is no easy
    means to do so.</p>
    <p>Because of this, first-party releases on decentralized content networks are rare, and
    resources are instead lavished on centralized apps.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
    <p>The feature-gap between centralized apps and decentralized content networks is vast.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there is a relatively simple way that we can close that gap:</p>
    <p>Developing standards for structured, machine-readable metadata in a simple, universal
    format.</p>
    <p>Existing content does contain metadata. However, this metadata is limited to specific
    content types, for example MP3 tags; or modes of transport, for example BitTorrent.</p>
    <p>By developing a standard for metadata manifests that can be accompany content, many
    desirable features become more reliable and dramatically easier to implement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Newly downloaded releases can be integrated into a library without user intervention. If
        the user has a preferred scheme for naming and tagging, that scheme can be applied
        automatically.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Content from a user's library can easily be exported for sharing in a format that's
        appropriate for the transportation medium, for example as a torrent or as a
        <code>.zip</code> archive.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By identifying the location and format of content in releases, that content can be
        extracted and transcoded automatically for mobile devices and web browsers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rich search indices can be built from collections of content, without needing to resort
        to complex and error-prone heuristics.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Immutable identifiers, for example ISBN numbers, allow metadata to be automatically
        updated from external sources.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Creators and publishers can include a Bitcoin tipping address in their releases, so end
        users can reward them directly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Releases can be signed, allowing users to verify the authenticity of content, and
        allowing publishers to create new releases that explicitly supersede old ones.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Standardized metadata would be a enormous boon to the decentralized content ecosystem, and
    the Intermodal project is my attempt to make this possibility a reality.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Intermodal</h2>
    <p>The project for developing these metadata standards, as well as tools and apps to make these
    standards useful, is called "Intermodal".</p>
    <p>Seamless intermodal transportation, enabled by containerization, has led to enormous
    efficiency gains in the transport of physical goods.</p>
    <p>Before the invention of the humble 40' shipping container, and the intermodal transportation
    network that it enabled, the majority of the world's goods were transported as so-called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_bulk_cargo">bulk break cargo</a>.</p>
    <p>Bulk break cargo is packed in bags, barrels, boxes, crates, and drums of varying sizes.
    Loading such cargo onto a truck, cargo ship, or train took labor and time, and was a major
    source of friction and cost in the shipping of goods from place to place.</p>
    <p>The invention and standardization of intermodal containers, the 20' and 40' shipping
    containers of today, changed all that. Cargo could now be packed into uniformly sized
    containers of known strength and weight, of a size suitable for transportation by train, truck,
    or ship. This standardization made the once back-breaking work of moving cargo through multiple
    transportation modes easy and fast. What once required teams of stout men could now be done
    easily with cranes and other equipment.</p>
    <p>In many ways, when it comes to decentralized digital content, we are very much living in an
    era of bulk break cargo. Painstaking effort is required to prepare content for transportation
    across different modes, e.g. BitTorrent, the web, or Usenet; and it is either impossible or
    takes complex hueristics to answer simple questions, like what <em>is</em> a piece of content,
    anyways?</p>
    <p>By standardizing metadata, we can make more efficient the conveyance of digital content
    across different modes of transportation, and allow rich services to be built on top of that
    content.</p>
    <p>Thus, "Intermodal".</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><code>imdl</code></h2>
    <p>After much hand-wringing and false starts, I decided that a good place to start would be a
    BitTorrent metainfo (that is to say, <code>.torrent</code> file) creator. The first version is
    full of features and nicities, and is ready for users today.</p>
    <p>The binary is called <code>imdl</code>, and development is hosted <a href=
    "https://github.com/casey/intermodal">on GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>BitTorrent is widely used, and a torrent creator is much simpler than a torrent client,
    tracker, or index, making a good place to start.</p>
    <p>Although <code>imdl</code> does not today have any groundbreaking new features, and no
    functionality for creating metadata manifests, it is a natural place to start adding such
    features.</p>
    <p><code>imdl</code> is written in Rust. Rust is fast, correct, and makes it easy to distribute
    self-contained binaries to users. Additionally, Rust can be compiled to <a href=
    "https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, so bits of <code>imdl</code> might eventually be
    adapted to run in the browser.</p>
    <p><code>imdl</code> will hopefully be extended with all manner of useful features, so
    torrent-creation functionality lives under the <code>torrent</code> subcommand: <code>imdl
    torrent create</code>, <code>imdl torrent verify</code>, <code>imdl torrent show</code>, and so
    on.</p>
    <p>I've tried to add all the useful features of existing torrent file creators that I could
    find, so hopefully <code>imdl</code> is immediately useful. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to
    the <a href="https://imdl.io/book/prior-art.html">many exiting open-source torrent
    creators</a>, which have been a font of inspiration and good ideas.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>First and foremost, I want <code>imdl</code> to be a useful torrent creator <em>today</em>.
    If you find any bugs, or have feature requests, don't hesitate to <a href=
    "https://github.com/casey/intermodal/issues/new">open an issue</a> or hop on <a href=
    "https://discord.gg/HaaT5Qz">the discord</a>!</p>
    <p>Contributions of code, documentation, clean up, tests, ideas, and discussion are all
    welcome!</p>
    <p>Beyond that, there are a few possible next steps.</p>
    <p>One possibility is fleshing out the standards for content metadata that I've described
    above. However, I'm not sure it's the right thing to do just yet. I'm worried that without any
    consumers of this metadata, like trackers and indices, I'll be designing for abstract users and
    use-cases, which is always a dangerous way to work.</p>
    <p>Another possibility is adding a simple tracker and web index to <code>imdl</code>. I could
    then work on the metadata standard while adding features that consume this metadata to the
    tracker and index. This would help ensure that the new metadata standard actually enables the
    intended concrete use-cases.</p>
    <p>I think the latter is more likely, but nothing is set in stone.</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for reading this rather long-winded blog post!</p>
    <p><code>imdl</code>, modest though it may be, is a love letter to the world, to sharing, and
    to BitTorrent. I hope you find it useful, and it becomes even more useful in the future.</p>

      <a href="/blog/decentralize-messaging/" class="title">Decentralize Messaging</a>
    </header>
    <p>Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">funding a team</a>
    to decentralize social media. I think they should start with messaging.</p>
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <h3>Why</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Messaging is a subset of social media.</li>
      <li>Users are tired of the wild proliferation of messaging apps.</li>
      <li>Social networks are all different, making them hard targets for standardization;
      messaging apps are all the same, making them easy targets for standardization and
      interoperability.</li>
      <li>Messaging is easier to scale.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Build on the matrix protocol.</li>
      <li>Extend email.</li>
      <li>Or maybe both.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why</h2>
    <h3>messaging is a subset of social media</h3>
    <p>Messaging is a key feature of all social media platforms; decentralizing messaging is a
    prerequisite to decentralizing social media. And, even though it is a subset of social media,
    it still captures many of social media's central challenges: spam, moderation, and, most
    importantly, identity.</p>
    <h3>users are tired of the wild proliferation of messaging apps</h3>
    <p>The average user is more negatively impacted by the proliferation of messaging apps than
    they are by the proliferation of social networks.</p>
    <p>I have heard many people express irritation that they must use an inordinate number of
    messaging apps to communicate.</p>
    <p>I haven't heard the same complaints regarding the proliferation of social media platforms.
    My best as to why this is the case is that the need to communicate one-on-one with an
    individual has no substitute. If I'm meeting Bob for lunch, being able to message anyone but
    Bob is completely useless. So, I must use whichever app Bob uses, or get Bob to use whatever
    app I use, and, if we don't have a common messaging app, one of us will need to install a new
    one, furthering the proliferation problem.</p>
    <h3>social network distinctiveness</h3>
    <p>It's tempting to think that decentralizing social media should be begin with the features
    that we most readily associate with social media platforms, like posts, news feeds, and liking.
    However, the implementations of these features differ, and different social media platforms
    provide very different experiences.</p>
    <p>This makes these features of social media a hard target for standardization. However, the
    messaging features of these platforms are all nearly identical, making messaging an easy target
    for standardization.</p>
    <p>The goal is to decentralize social media as a whole, not just messaging, but messaging can
    be used as an initial step, with further extensions tackling the various individual features of
    social media platforms.</p>
    <h3>messaging is easier to scale</h3>
    <p>At the upper end, tens of millions of users may engage with an individual tweet, whereas
    group messages are limited to no more than fifty users. This makes messaging a more attractive
    initial target for decentralization, since it avoids needing to hit massive scale on day
    one.</p>
    <h3>a clear target</h3>
    <p>So, to summarize all the above, decentralized messaging has an obvious target feature set to
    aim for, a strong benefit to end users that will drive adoption, puts off hard scaling
    challenges, and can be extended in the future to all the features we associate with social
    media.</p>
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>I see two promising and complementary paths to decentralized messaging: building on the new
    and shiny <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix protocol</a>, and gradually extending email.</p>
    <p>The Matrix protocol has the huge advantage of being modern. It already supports many, if not
    most, of the features of modern messaging apps.</p>
    <p>Email, on the other hand, is ancient, weird, and has no support for modern luxuries like
    end-to-end encryption or user-presence notifications. However, email is extremely widely
    adopted, and a broadly supported and popular "Email 2.0" might receive a great deal of
    support.</p>
    <p>Although it would be a challenging process to navigate, email could be extended with
    features until it reaches parity with modern messaging apps, and further extended to support
    the features of existing social media networks. These extensions can be added in backwards
    compatible ways that allow mail agents to negotiate upgrades, falling back to plain email when
    extensions are not available.</p>
    <p>These extensions could include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>delivery receipts</li>
      <li>optional read receipts</li>
      <li>user presence information</li>
      <li>binary serialization for efficiency and extensibility</li>
      <li>end-to-end encryption</li>
      <li>WebRTC signalling for negotiating VOIP and video chat</li>
      <li>signed introduction tokens to reduce spam</li>
      <li>a standard extension mechanism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A hybrid approach might be to design an email-to-matrix protocol upgrade negotiation
    mechanism, allowing legacy email addresses to seamlessly upgrade to a modern messaging
    protocol.</p>
    <p>Whatever the approach, building a decentralized messaging protocol and integrating it into
    twitter would serve as an excellent foot in the door for decentralizing the entire social media
    landscape.</p>

      Become a Browser</a> <span class="tags"><a href=
      "/blog/tag/programming/">programming</a></span>
    </header>
    <p><em>I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice.</em></p>
    <p>Popcorn Time-style video streaming apps seem to be vulnerable to legal action by
    rightsholders.</p>
    <p>For example, the <a href=
    "https://torrentfreak.com/registrar-suspends-popcorn-time-domain-name-following-complaint-200121/">
    popcorntime.sh domain was recently suspended</a>, and <a href=
    "https://torrentfreak.com/operator-of-popcorn-time-info-site-is-liable-for-piracy-supreme-court-rules-200115/">
    the operator of a site which merely provided information about how to obtain and use Popcorn
    Time was sentenced to prison</a>.</p>
    <p>Although given that Popcorn Time's servers do not themselves host infringing content this
    may seem a bit unfair, it is simply the reality of the world we live in.</p>
    <p>It is interesting to note, however, that although web browsers can be used in exactly the
    same way as Popcorn Time, namely searching for and viewing copyrighted movies, the developers
    of web browsers have thus far not faced successful legal challenges.</p>
    <p>I believe that there are two major factors that differentiate Popcorn Time from web
    browsers, and contribute to Popcorn Time's legal vulnerability:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Upon opening a web browser, the user must supply the URL of the site they wish to visit.
        Compare this to Popcorn Time, where upon opening the application for the first time, the
        user is immediately presented with a selection of unlicensed Hollywood movies to
        download.</p>
        <p>This difference greatly weakens Popcorn Time's claims against contributory copyright
        infringement. The developers of Popcorn Time cannot credibly claim to be ignorant to the
        types of movies that their users are downloading, whereas a web browser developer can
        credibly claim that the choice of website to visit is always left to the end user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Web browsers have substantial non-infringing uses. "Substantial non-infringing use" is
        jargon for a legal test used in the United States which protects the creator or purveyor of
        a piece of technology from liability for its use in infringement by users if that
        technology has "substantial non-infringing uses". For the canonical example, see <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Universal_City_Studios,_Inc."><em>Sony
        Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.</em></a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Whereas a web browser provider can rightly claim that there are many websites, <a href=
    "https://youtu.be/2JO3oJybBTw">and it's possible an infringing one might slip in, there would
    be no way of knowing</a>, the popcorn time developers cannot claim the same. There is a single,
    fixed Popcorn Time backend, run by the Popcorn Time team, serving the same search results to
    every user.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, even given the above, I believe that Popcorn Time could implement a small
    number of strategic changes that would allow it to withstand future legal aggression:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a URL bar, like a web browser's, to the top of the current GUI.</li>
      <li>Make the URL bar empty when opening the app for the first time, and display no default
      search results to the user.</li>
      <li>When the user enters a URL, use the existing Popcorn Time API protocol to contact the
      backend at that URL, and begin displaying search results from that backend to the user.</li>
      <li>If the app is closed and re-opened, keep the URL bar and the search results populated
      from the last run of the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These changes would be simple, have a minimal impact on the current (quite excellent!) user
    experience, and leverage interaction flows, i.e. a URL bar, that users already understand.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the Popcorn Time team should create an official default search backend which
    focuses exclusively on free, non-infringing, user-created content.</p>
    <p>These steps would, I believe, nicely protect the developers and distributors of Popcorn Time
    from further legal challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Popcorn Time, when first opened, would display no search results by default, and would
        require the user to direct the app with the URL of a site that they would like to visit.
        This would avoid the current situation where a litigator sitting in front of a judge can
        open the Popcorn Time application, and it will by immediately display a choice selection of
        infringing content, which makes for a terrible first impression.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Users of the Popcorn Time application could use it to access both infringing and
        non-infringing content, providing a nice argument that the application does in fact have
        <em>substantial non-infringing uses</em>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Infringement via the application would be entirely at the direction of the end-user, and
        not directly assisted by the default search results provided by the developers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Developers wouldn't be running a search back end with infringing content, which is the
        only component of the current Popcorn Time system that stores problematic metadata about
        infringing content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I suspect that the official free-content focused search backend would be successful and
        useful in its own right.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the search backend could now be switched by end users, a very large number of
        third-party backends would likely appear, serving content that might not be otherwise
        available from the current Popcorn Time backend.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, Popcorn Time should become a browser, and then all those lawyers and their
    handlers can go pound sand.</p>

        <p>The existing implementation provided by your system serves as a specification, giving

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The core functionality of these utilities is very simple, allowing a learner to quickly
        build something useful. And, many have additional features, allowing a learner to add and
        build if they wish. <code>ls</code> is simple, but <code>ls -l</code> is quite the
        project!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Many creative additions are possible, like colorful output, expressive configuration,
        and fun and useful new features.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>IO and error handling are often front-and-center when writing these utilities, which
        provides a great chance to get used to explicit error handling.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt">structopt</a> makes argument parsing a
        breeze. And, by leveraging the type system and custom-derive, it provides a nice example of
        a situation where Rust has enormous advantages over other languages, allowing you to do
        more with less code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rust binaries are fast to load and run, so performance is on par with native C
        implementations, and often much better than implementations in slower languages.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rust binaries are self-contained, so packaging and distribution is manageable, so you
        can share your work with the world.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It's fun to use utilities that you wrote in your day-to-day workflow!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are lots of fabulous examples of utilities in the rust ecosystem, like <a href=
        "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, <a href=
        "https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">exa</a>, and <a href=
        "https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl">hexyl</a>. (Damn, David Peter is a beast.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you're teaching others, a simple utility like <code>strings</code> makes for a great
        demonstration of the basics of the language.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think whether you start with the book or a project like this depends on the learner.</p>
    <p>I much prefer to jump in and struggle mightily, so I started with a project like this (what
    eventually became <a href="https://github.com/casey/just/">just</a>), but I think a lot of
    people might prefer to start with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>, or at
    least parts of the book.</p>

    </header>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a>-inspired modification of
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04439">Dandelion</a> for use in <a href=
    "https://grin-tech.org/">Grin</a>.</p>
    <h3><em>What</em></h3>
    <p>On boot and restart, Grin nodes pick a random 256-bit <em>node id</em> which is broadcast to
    their peers.</p>
    <p>Upon receiving a block, a new <em>epoch</em> begins if <code>block_height % 10 == 0</code>.
    The <em>epoch id</em> is the 256-bit blake2b hash of the block hash of the block that started
    the epoch. (I.E. the double blake2b hash of the block header.)</p>
    <p>At the start of each epoch, every node:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Calculates the <em>relay weight</em> of itself and all peers using the formula:
        <code>relay_weight = peer_id xor epoch_id</code>. Relay weight is interpreted as a 256 bit
        unsigned integer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selects the node among itself and all peers with the highest relay weight as the
        <em>relay target</em>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Determines that it is in <em>stem mode</em> if the relay target is a peer, and in
        <em>fluff mode</em> if the relay target is itself.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, for every stem transaction received:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If it is in stem mode, it immediately relays it to its relay target.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If it is in fluff mode, it aggregates transactions until its next patience timer
        expires, then broadcast them.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Why</em></h3>
    <p>"Heavy" peers will naturally be chosen for relay targets, creating agreed-upon stem paths
    and fluff sinks, and leading to more opportunities for transaction aggregation.</p>
    <h3><em>Notes</em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In a well-connected network, one node may be the sink for all transactions during a
        given epoch, and thus see all unaggregated transactions during the epoch. It may thus be
        desirable to stick to random mode selection as in Dandelion++, so as to break up stem paths
        with randomly selected fluff sinks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If block hashes are used directly as the epoch ID, peers could select peer IDs with a
        large number of leading 1s, thus biasing relay target selection towards themselves. Thus,
        we take the double blake2b hash of the block header as the epoch ID.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the epoch ID is known by all, a node could pick node IDs that had high relay
        weight during that epoch. To provent this, if a node connects to a new peer it should use a
        randomly assigned peer ID for the current epoch.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Should this modification be called <em>Kademlion</em>, or
        <em>Objective-Dandelion</em>?</p>
      </li>
      <li>

        "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues/2176">clear description of Dandelion++</a>

    <p>Maybe it was miasmatic vapors rising up from beneath South of Market streets. Maybe it was
    the widening gyre opening up under the world. Maybe it was nothing at all. I don't know.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network">Lightning Network</a> has
      the potential to greatly improve cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Lighting Network payment channels could be established between users and exchanges to
      speed the transfer of funds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>This would be a huge boon, moving many on-chain deposit and withdrawal transactions
      off-chain, but is possibly only the beginning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Since Lightning Network payments can span different blockchains, an exchange could use a
      cross-chain Lightning node to expose its internal order book to external entities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As an example, imagine that an exchange has an LTC/BTC trading pair and wants to allow
      non-exchange users to fill the orders in their order book.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The exchange runs a lightning node with a BTC channel and an LTC channel:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>x:   exchange node
a:   third party node
b:   third party node
&lt;-&gt;: payment channel

   BTC     LTC
a &lt;---&gt; x &lt;---&gt; b</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The exchange dynamically sets the exchange rates across the channels based on their
      current best bid, best ask, and fee schedule.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>With a best ask of 0.6 and a 1% fee, the exchange sets the BTC→LTC exchange rate like
      so:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>   BTC     LTC
a ----&gt; x ----&gt; b
  0.606   1.000</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When a payment is routed across the channels in this direction, LTC sell orders are
      filled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>With a best bid of 0.4 and a 1% fee, the exchange sets the exchange rate on the channel in
      the LTC→BTC direction like so:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>   BTC     LTC
a &lt;---- x &lt;---- b
  0.400   1.010</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>A payment routed in this direction fills LTC buy orders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In this way, exchanges can expose their internal order book externally and trustlessly.
      Anyone who wishes to make cross-chain Lightning Network payments will discover and travel
      over these routes with no special effort required by the exchange, assuming that their rates
      are competitive. Also, it’s likely that third parties will appear whose sole purpose is to
      search the Lightning Network for arbitrage loops and travel them until they are exhausted,
      thus bridging multiple exchanges when their order books cross.</p>

    <p>Investing in cryptocurrencies is not the same as buying simple equity in a company.</p>
    <p>Although each company has a different business model, they and the equity they issue are
    largely structurally homogeneous. They hold their monies in banks, pay for their expenses with
    wire transfers and cheques, follow prescribed rules of accounting, and issue stock that
    operates according to well understood rules. This is not to say that said practices are good or
    bad. They are simply a known factor.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies and tokens, however, are structurally heterogeneous. They have different
    codebases, modes of operation, levels of complexity, and security models. Although broadly
    lumped into the same category, they can, by the nature of these differences, have almost
    nothing in common.</p>
    <p>Investing in one is like buying stock in a company with novel business models, banking
    practices, and accounting methods, and furthermore whose stock is issued under a bespoke scheme
    and follows unique trading rules.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, a much, much greater level of care is required when making such investments. If
    any one of these novel mechanisms fail, your investment may go up in billowing smoke and flames
    overnight.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that you should completely avoid cryptocurrencies and tokens, just, you
    know, do your homework.</p>

    </header>
    <p>Programs first crawled from the murky oceans as simple lists of instructions that executed
    in sequence. From these humble beginnings they have since evolved an astonishing number of ways
    of delinearizing.</p>
    <p>In fact, most programming paradigms simply amount to different ways to transform a linear
    source file into a program with nonlinear behavior.</p>
    <p>Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>gotos that unconditionally jump to another point in the program</li>
      <li>an abort instruction that stops the program at some point other than the end</li>
      <li>a macro facility that substitutes one instruction for one or more other instructions</li>
      <li>a source file concatenation facility that concatenates multiple source files</li>
      <li>an include directive that is substituted for the contents of a source file</li>
      <li>structured repetition and selection, a la for, while, if, and switch</li>
      <li>subroutines and functions</li>
      <li>array oriented programming that replace explicit repetition with implicit repetition</li>
      <li>first class functions which delegation of behavior to the caller</li>
      <li>object oriented programming with dynamic dispatch, which allow the runtime type of an
      object to determine which instructions to execute</li>
      <li>aspect oriented programming, pattern matching against the structure of the call stack to
      execute instructions when functions are called or return</li>
      <li>event driven programming, executing instructions in response to external events</li>
      <li>declarative programming, which essentially delegates execution of one program to

    <p>This is pretty nuts. I was poking around in the storage area of my house, and I found a huge
    cardboard box filled with letters and audio cassettes and dust. Everything was Danish, German,
    and English, but mostly Danish. The name Max Rasmussen was everywhere, so I think it was all
    his stuff. I had to get a tape player at best buy to play the tapes, but surprisingly, they all
    played fine. One of them was an interview, in English, between Max and a man named Hans. I
    listened to it a few times, and I don't even know what to say. It's transcribed below.</p>

    <p>"What kinds of things can you tell the computer you want?" she asked excitedly, her cheeks

    <p>He thought for a moment, and began stroking her hair gently. "All kinds of things. There's a
    language called prolog you can use to ask about logical relationships. In SQL you can ask
    questions about huge quantities of data. With a program like bison you can declaratively
    describe a language, letting bison generate a program that recognizes it."</p>
